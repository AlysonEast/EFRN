This folder contains the workflow for the First steps of network analysis

1) Run process_data_poly.sh
fields from shell file
	EXPORT_PCA_DATA: No longer in use, as PCA's have been removed from the workflow
	EXPORT_NA_DATA: Needed for standardizing data. Writes out all environmental variables as ascii file and comuted mean and std devs for the entire US
	IMPORT_POLYGON: Reading in the polygon file for the EFRN sites
	RASTERIZE_FORESTS: Rastarizes polygons of EFRN sites
	EXTRACT_DATA_AT_EF: Uses UNIVAR to calcualte averages within EFRN polygons
	RESTRUCTURE_UNIVAR: Pulls the means out of the UNIVAR files and and standardizes them agenst NA_DATA
	CALCULATE_REPRESENTATIVENESS: Runs Jitu's oridnation code and stores the outputs
	IMPORT_REPRESENTATIVENESS_MAPS: generates representatovness maps
	IMPORT_CONSTITUENCY_MAPS: generates constituency maps
	GENERATE_DRIVERS_MAP: Uses R script to take row maxs and means for each pixel in CONUS
		Uses netrep_drivers.R
	CALC_SRS: Clips to SRS extent
	EXPORT_TIF: Exports Grass rasters to tif for local download

2) identify_new_sites.sh
 - Firest thing to run computes a histogram of the distribution of forested NETREP values, and gives the median and 25%. The 25th percentile is the cutoff for poor representation and needs to be manually entered into the file poor_rep_lims.txt 
	MAP_POOR_REP: Genreates a binary of firested poorly represetned sites.
		-Relient on poor_rep_lims.txt. Needs to be manually updated
	ID_NEW_SITES: Finds sites that overlap with poorly represented cells and writes out a shapfile of those sites to export, and takes site averages to feed into netrep calculations
	CALC_NETREP: Runs Jitu's ordination script and calculates average representation for each site one site at a time in a forloop
	CALC_FINAL: may not be nessiary... 
 
3) identify_new_sites_SRS.sh
	-Exactily the same as 2, but clipped to SRS with SRS attached to all outputs and inputs
	-Also needs poor_rep_lims_SRS.txt manually updated

4) Graphics Generation:
 summary_plots_data.sh
	-Generates datasets in ascii formate from grass data to feed into R for graphics for the final MS
 summary_plots.R
	-Uses outputs from above to generate graphics and outputs them to ../figures
